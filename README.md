A project full of fake, pointless consoles‚Äîpacked into a single HTML file. No real use. Just for fun.

**Threat Map**
A realistic threat monitoring dashboard inspired by the classic War Games movie aesthetic. The dashboard generates completely random dummy data and runs continuously with new "attacks" appearing every 1-3 seconds. All data is fictional and for demonstration purposes only. The single HTML file is fully self-contained and will work offline once saved.

The result is a cinematic and engaging experience that feels like something from a high-tech command center or blockbuster movie. The animations are layered and synchronized to create a truly immersive "cyber warfare" atmosphere while maintaining the classic terminal aesthetic.

The map is about as useful as the flashy ones from big-name security vendors‚Äîlooks cool, tells you nothing.

**Voight-Kampff Machine**
A Blade Runner-inspired Voight-Kampff machine simulator! This will be a faithful recreation of the device from the movie, complete with the retro-futuristic aesthetic and randomly generated empathy test questions. The "Analyze" button performs a simulated analysis of the subject's responses. Here's what it actually does:
1. Calculates fake metrics based on random numbers and simple algorithms:
- Empathy Index: Random score between 60-100
- Average Response Time: Calculated from actual typing/response times
- Stress Level: Based on simulated heart rate readings
- Classification: Determined by the empathy score (Human/Suspect/Replicant)

2. Visual feedback: Changes status lights and displays results in the analysis panel

**The SOC Console**
The SOC Console is a fake, self-contained HTML console that looks like something straight out of an early SOC. Perfect for impressing a gullible client‚Äîor a sales rep (no offense).

It runs on dummy data but feels surprisingly real, with just enough action to keep things interesting.

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: highly addictive. Use responsibly (or not).

**The Hacker Terminal**
The Hacker Terminal is a first stab at recreating those flashy ‚Äúhacking scenes‚Äù everyone loves in movies‚Äîand yes, your coworkers too. It‚Äôs all fake, just a bunch of dummy stuff. Nothing real, nothing dangerous.

Still, it looks cool. Like the other fake consoles shared here, it‚Äôs perfect for running in a browser kiosk-mode on a second monitor at the office. Great for impressing visitors‚Äîespecially the clueless ones.
