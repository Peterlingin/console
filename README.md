A project full of fake, pointless consolesâ€”packed into a single HTML file. No real use. Just for fun.

**Threat Map
**
A realistic threat monitoring dashboard inspired by the classic War Games movie aesthetic. The dashboard generates completely random dummy data and runs continuously with new "attacks" appearing every 1-3 seconds. All data is fictional and for demonstration purposes only. The single HTML file is fully self-contained and will work offline once saved.

The result is a cinematic and engaging experience that feels like something from a high-tech command center or blockbuster movie. The animations are layered and synchronized to create a truly immersive "cyber warfare" atmosphere while maintaining the classic terminal aesthetic.
