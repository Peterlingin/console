A project full of fake, pointless consolesâ€”packed into a single HTML file. No real use. Just for fun.

**Threat Map**
A realistic threat monitoring dashboard inspired by the classic War Games movie aesthetic. The dashboard generates completely random dummy data and runs continuously with new "attacks" appearing every 1-3 seconds. All data is fictional and for demonstration purposes only. The single HTML file is fully self-contained and will work offline once saved.

The result is a cinematic and engaging experience that feels like something from a high-tech command center or blockbuster movie. The animations are layered and synchronized to create a truly immersive "cyber warfare" atmosphere while maintaining the classic terminal aesthetic.

**Voight-Kampff Machine**
A Blade Runner-inspired Voight-Kampff machine simulator! This will be a faithful recreation of the device from the movie, complete with the retro-futuristic aesthetic and randomly generated empathy test questions. The "Analyze" button performs a simulated analysis of the subject's responses. Here's what it actually does:
1. Calculates fake metrics based on random numbers and simple algorithms:
- Empathy Index: Random score between 60-100
- Average Response Time: Calculated from actual typing/response times
- Stress Level: Based on simulated heart rate readings
- Classification: Determined by the empathy score (Human/Suspect/Replicant)

3. Visual feedback: Changes status lights and displays results in the analysis panel
