**Threat Map**

A realistic threat monitoring dashboard inspired by the classic War Games movie aesthetic. The dashboard generates completely random dummy data and runs continuously with new "attacks" appearing every 1-3 seconds. All data is fictional and for demonstration purposes only. The single HTML file is fully self-contained and will work offline once saved.

The result is a cinematic and engaging experience that feels like something from a high-tech command center or blockbuster movie. The animations are layered and synchronized to create a truly immersive "cyber warfare" atmosphere while maintaining the classic terminal aesthetic.

ü•∂ The map is about as useful as the flashy ones from big-name security vendors‚Äîlooks cool, tells you nothing.

**Voight-Kampff Machine**

A Blade Runner-inspired Voight-Kampff machine simulator! This will be a faithful recreation of the device from the movie, complete with the retro-futuristic aesthetic and randomly generated empathy test questions. The "Analyze" button performs a simulated analysis of the subject's responses. Here's what it actually does:
1. Calculates fake metrics based on random numbers and simple algorithms:
- Empathy Index: Random score between 60-100
- Average Response Time: Calculated from actual typing/response times
- Stress Level: Based on simulated heart rate readings
- Classification: Determined by the empathy score (Human/Suspect/Replicant)

2. Visual feedback: Changes status lights and displays results in the analysis panel

**The SOC Console**

The SOC Console is a fake, self-contained HTML console that looks like something straight out of an early SOC. Perfect for impressing a gullible client‚Äîor a sales rep (no offense).

It runs on dummy data but feels surprisingly real, with just enough action to keep things interesting.

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: highly addictive. Use responsibly (or not).

**The Hacker Terminal**

The Hacker Terminal is a first stab at recreating those flashy ‚Äúhacking scenes‚Äù everyone loves in movies‚Äîand yes, your coworkers too. The sequence automatically plays out a complete penetration test scenario, demonstrating a realistic attack path that security professionals might encounter during authorized testing. It's purely educational and shows how attackers might chain together vulnerabilities to compromise systems.

Visual Features:
- Authentic terminal window with controls
- Green-on-black hacker aesthetic
- Typing animation that mimics real typing
- Blinking cursor
- Status bar with network information
- Subtle visual effects for immersion

It‚Äôs all fake, just a bunch of dummy stuff. Nothing real, nothing dangerous. Still, it looks cool. Like the other fake consoles shared here, it‚Äôs perfect for running in a browser kiosk-mode on a second monitor at the office. Great for impressing visitors‚Äîespecially the clueless ones.

**The AS/400 5250 Terminal**

A highly realistic AS/400 5250 terminal emulator that captures the authentic look and feel of IBM's classic green-screen interface. Here are the key features:

Authentic Design Elements:
- Classic green-on-black color scheme with scan lines effect
- IBM Plex Mono font (IBM's official font) for maximum authenticity
- Proper AS/400 screen layout with system information headers
- Realistic function key labels (F1=Help, F3=Exit, F12=Cancel, etc.)
- Proper AS/400 system naming (IBMI001, QINTER subsystem)
- Subtle screen flicker effect for CRT monitor simulation
- Tab navigation between fields

Functionality:
- Login: Use 'user' and 'password' (case-insensitive)
- Error Handling: Displays the authentic CPF1107 error message for incorrect credentials
- Success: Shows a realistic customer financial data screen with fake credit card information
- Navigation: F3 or F12 keys return to login screen 

The terminal behaves exactly like a real AS/400 system would, complete with proper error messages and screen transitions. The fake credit card data is clearly fictional and formatted in the style typical of AS/400 business applications.

**Hollywood Hacking Tropes Exposed**

The screen is a blur of neon green text on a black background, reminiscent of the 1990s. The hacker's fingers fly across the keyboard, a flurry of rapid-fire keystrokes. This is a fantastic example of Hollywood "hacking" that perfectly captures all the classic tropes! 

Every good movie hacker scene starts with the intimidating "RESTRICTED ACCESS" screen with scary warnings.

An interactive fake movie hacker experience that recreates those classic over-the-top authentication scenes. But here‚Äôs the twist: only one username and password combo actually works!

**Cybersecurity Buzzword Generator**

A "professional" cybersecurity phrase generator that mimics the style of big-name consultancy slides. It‚Äôs called *Garpner* (totally not a reference to any pricey firms you may know). It randomly mixes buzzwords from four categories to crank out thousands of polished-sounding nonsense phrases. Perfect for your next fake briefing.

The page is completely self-contained and can be saved as an HTML file to use offline. Just click "Generate Insight" to produce a new phrase with a smooth fade animation. Perfect for any cybersecurity conference or presentation where you need to sound strategic without committing to anything specific!
